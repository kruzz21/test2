  # Fix FAQ Insert Policy

  1. Security Changes
    - Drop existing insert policy for faqs table
    - Create new insert policy that properly allows anonymous users to submit questions
    - Ensure the policy allows both anon and authenticated users to insert new FAQs
    - Set proper with_check condition to allow inserts without restrictions

  This fixes the RLS policy violation error when users try to submit questions through the FAQ form.
