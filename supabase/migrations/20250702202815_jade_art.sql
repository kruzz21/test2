  # Fix appointments table RLS policy

  1. Security Updates
    - Drop existing policies that might be conflicting
    - Recreate proper RLS policies for appointments table
    - Ensure anonymous users can create appointments
    - Ensure authenticated users (admins) can manage all appointments

  2. Changes
    - Allow anonymous and authenticated users to insert appointments
    - Allow authenticated users to read, update, and delete all appointments
    - Maintain data security while enabling public appointment creation
