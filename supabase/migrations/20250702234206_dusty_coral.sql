  # Fix FAQ Submissions Delete Policy

  1. Security Updates
    - Add DELETE policy for faq_submissions table to allow admin operations
    - Grant DELETE permission to authenticated users (admins)
    - This allows the admin panel to remove FAQ submissions after answering them

  2. Changes
    - Add DELETE policy for authenticated users on faq_submissions table
    - Grant DELETE permission to authenticated role
    - Ensure the workflow can complete: answer FAQ â†’ delete submission

  This fixes the "permission denied for table faq_submissions" error when trying to delete
  processed FAQ submissions after answering them.
