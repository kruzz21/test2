  # Fix Row Level Security Policies

  This migration fixes RLS policies to ensure proper access for:
  1. Anonymous users creating reviews
  2. Admin operations for fetching appointments and reviews
  3. Public access to approved content

  ## Changes Made
  1. Updated review creation policy for anonymous users
  2. Ensured admin can access all appointment data
  3. Fixed policy conditions for proper access control

  ## Security
  - Maintains security while allowing necessary operations
  - Anonymous users can create reviews (pending approval)
  - Authenticated users (admin) have full access to manage content
  - Public users can only read approved content
