  # Simplify FAQ RLS Policy

  1. Changes
    - Drop the existing complex INSERT policy for FAQs
    - Create a simple INSERT policy that matches the appointments table approach
    - Use WITH CHECK (true) to allow any valid insert
    - Rely on application logic to set proper defaults

  2. Security
    - Maintains security through application-level validation
    - Allows anonymous users to submit FAQ questions
    - Keeps existing policies for reading approved FAQs and admin management
